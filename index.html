								<h3>December 14th 2014</h3>
								<h4>From: Mimetics</h4>
								<p>Mimetics’ has developed the “Jade Robot” based on over 20 years of “learning” from hundreds of robotics workshops with over 15,000 youth, aged 8 to 18.  Jade is fun to operate and easy-to-use, with on-board programming plus a web based Google app for Scratch and C programming.  Jade is a great way to introduce anyone to “real robotics, science, math and programming”.</p>

								<p>Santa has automated this year with the Mimetics Jade Robot – How about you? Santa knows kids love robots and want to create programs in seconds so he really likes how easily he can develop programs on Jade's built in user interface or by using its Scratch or C programming and Jade's Google App ....all wirelessly with Jade's built-in Bluetooth.  Santa's not only ordered lots of Jade Robots for the North Pole, but he's giving the reindeer a rest and using the Jade Robot to help him make deliveries this Christmas.</p>
